{"name":"OmniAuth Passport","body":"# OmniAuth Passport\r\n\r\nThis gem contains the Everyday Hero Passport strategy for OmniAuth.\r\n\r\n## Experimental\r\n\r\nThis gem will only work if you have a copy of our OAuth2 server running locally on http://passport.edh.dev which probably isn't you. Once we sought out the URL structure I will make a 1.0.0 release.\r\n\r\n## How To Use It\r\n\r\nUsage is as per any other OmniAuth 2.0 strategy. Add the strategy to your `Gemfile`:\r\n\r\n    gem 'omniauth-passport', '~> 0.0.1'\r\n\r\nAfter adding the gem you will need to `bundle install` and create `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`.\r\n\r\n    Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do\r\n      provider :passport, ENV['PASSPORT_KEY'], ENV['PASSPORT_SECRET']\r\n    end\r\n\r\nThe typical convention for key / secret pairs is storing them in an environment variable. Lots of tools (e.g. POW and Procfile) will source an environment file before loading which is a great place to put the environment variables.\r\n\r\nCurrently we are returning the users `name`, `email` and `uid`.\r\n\r\nFor more information on hooking up omniauth checkout the README at: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth\r\n","tagline":"Everyday Hero Passport","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
